"jump 112" game. 

Description:
In this game, you control a man by using the left and right arrow keys.
The objective in this game is to try to get as high as possible of a score. This means
that you should try to land on each block to get higher and higher. Additionally, you 'die'
in this game if you fall off the bottom of the screen. There will also be bombs descending 
randomly, which you will have to dodge. The bombs will go off and kill you if you do not dodge them.
Additionally, there will be 'special' blocks. Moving blocks move, and blocks with a spring on them
will make you jump higher. There are also descending coins, which increase your overall score. Thus. 
the score is a combination of time survived and how many coins you collect.
